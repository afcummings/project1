Topic: Relationship between obesity and Alcohol consumption(spirit and bear)

1st Problem statement: Does the consumption of alcohol, i.e spirit, affect obesity?

Hypothesis: If alcohol (spirit) correlates with obesity, then consuming 1 more liter of spirit per person for 1 year will increase obesity level.

Alternative hypothesis: If alcohol (spirit) negatively correlates with obesity, then consuming 1 more liter of spirit for 1 year will decrease obesity level by -9.18%

2nd Problem statement: Does the consumption of alcohol, i.e bear, affect obesity?
Hypothesis: If alcohol (bear) positively correlates with obesity, then consuming 1 liter of bear for 1 year will inrease obesity level.


Alternative hypothesis: If alcohol (beer) negatively correlates with obesity, then consuming 1 liter of bear for 1 year will decrease obesity level. 

The regression model can be written as:
Y= B0 + B1X1 + B2X2
where Y =obesity.
where B0 = the expected level of obesity when alcohol (spirit and bear) consumption are zero.
where B1 and B2 = spirit and bear respectively.
where X1 and X2 = the impact of spirit and bear on obesity.
 
 

Interpretation of results:
Results show that obesity depends negatively on alcohol(Spirit), and positivley on beer
The estimate of the intercept, B0 = 0.0396, indicates that the expected level of adult obesity  is 3.96%when alcohol (spirit and bear) consumption are zero. The estimate of the first slope coefficient, B1=-0.1314 indicates that a unit (i.e 1 liter) of spirit consumes generates a decrease in obesity by 13.14%. The estimate of the 2nd slope coefficient, B2= 0.0643 indicates that 1 liter of beer consumes leads to an increase in obesity by 6.43%
The adjusted R square =  0.319 and it indicates that changes in both spirit and beer consumption account for 31.9% of changes in obesity. Which means 68.1% changes in obesity can be attributed to other variables not in this model. Hence, it can be said that the effect of spirit and beer consumption are insignificant in explaining obesity.


With the nature of our dataset, i.e the alcohol data are in unit of liter per person, and the obesity data are in thousands, hence, line graph won't be plausible in this analysis, hence, we made a scatter plot. Whilst we have used the difference equation method to correct the presence of autocorrelation, yet a small presence remains which could also be due to the sample size that is not robust.

Answer to the first hypothesis:
Y = 0.0396 + (-0.1314)(1) = -9.18%
Based on this result, we reject the hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis that the level of obesity will reduce by consuming 1 more of spirit in one year

Answer to the second hypothesis
Y = 0.0396 + 0.0643(1) = 10.39%
Based on this result, we accept the hypothesis that consuming 1 more liter of bear for 1 year will inrease obesity level by 10.39%
and reject the alternative hypothesis that the level of obesity will reduce by consuming 1 more of beer in one year.

Prediction,
Based on our findings, if values of X1 and X2 are given as 2 and 3 litrs of spirit and beer respectively, then;
 
 Y = 0.0396 + [-0.1314(2)] + 0.0643(3)= -3.03%
